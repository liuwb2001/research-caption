Prompt_1: The image depicts a scene on a road with multiple vehicles. In the foreground, there is a silver SUV that appears to be in motion, with its front end slightly elevated off the ground, suggesting it may have envolved in an accident. The SUV is positioned on the right side of the road, which is marked with white lane markings.
Behind the SUV, there is a red car that has been involved in a collision with the silver SUV. The red car is now stationary and is positioned on the left side of the road. The front end of the red car is damaged, with visible scratches and dents.
In the background, there is a white car that is also stationary, positioned behind the red car. The white car appears to be uninvolved in the incident and is waiting for the situation to clear.
The road itself is a two-way street with a center divider. There are no visible pedestrians or cyclists in the image. The setting appears to be an urban environment, with buildings and other infrastructure visible in the background.
There are no visible texts or distinctive branding in the image. The style of the image is a standard, non-stylized photograph, likely taken with a smartphone or a similar type of camera. The image captures a moment of an accident, with no people visible in the immediate vicinity of the incident. 

Prompt_2: The image captures a dynamic scene on a city street. Dominating the foreground is a silver SUV, its front end crumpled and slightly tilted, indicating it has been involved in a collision. The SUV is positioned on the right side of the street, facing towards the left side of the image.
In the background, two cars are visible. On the left side of the street, there's a red car, its body intact. On the right side, a white car is also present, its position suggesting it might have been involved in the incident with the SUV.
The street itself is lined with trees, providing a natural backdrop to this urban setting. The road is marked with white lines, typical of city streets, and there's a sidewalk visible on the right side of the image.
The image does not contain any text or additional objects that can be confidently identified. The relative positions of the objects suggest a typical city street scene with vehicles and nature coexisting.

Prompt_3: In the image, there is a scene on a road with multiple vehicles. A red car is in the process of flipping over, with its wheels off the ground and its body in mid-air. The car is positioned in the center of the road, with its front facing towards the right side of the image.
A silver car is approaching the red car from the left side of the image, and it appears to be in motion, as indicated by the blurred wheels. The silver car is closer to the camera than the red car, suggesting it is further down the road.
